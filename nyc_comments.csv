"wvxf-dwi5","Housing Maintenance Code Violations",,"Thank you Socrata and NYC Open Data for making this so accessible!  I've found an inaccuracy in the way this data is being handled - it seems the violationIDs are being treated as unique ids for this table. This is not the way the city handles the data (see the violation files documentation here: http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/about/open-data.page) There should be a record every time the a particular violation's status is updated. Instead, only the latest violation status is available. While this is fine if someone only cares about the latest status, it makes a historical perspective on violation handling difficult/impossible.  A quick example: this view (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/violation_id-is-10407848/w4i9-r9s5) shows only 1 status for the particular violationId. However, there have to be at least 2 - the NOV_issued date (October/Nov 2014) and the date closed, and potentially more in between.  It is true that the city has written themselves out of their own historical perspective as well (at least from the available data on their site). As the fields have changed, they've struck the old docs and included only the latest version of every violation's status at that point in time, making it impossible to see accurate pre-october-2012 violation progression. It would be nice to at least handle what we do have access to properly.","2015-09-09 08:38:48.525","approved",
